## Introduction

An Atomic Reducer looks like this:

```js
{
  entities: {},
  order: [],
  selected: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null
}
```

The idea is that this reducer is the smallest _atmoic_ state unit, to be
composed with other atomic reducers to build more complex reducers which might
handle multiple data types.
The advantage of this is that each atomic reducer manages the data for a
single entity, thereby avoiding bloated reducer logic.

## Quick start

Install with `npm` or `yarn`.

```sh
npm install atomic-reducer
```

```sh
yarn add atomic-reducer
```

Define atomic reducer's in your project.

```js
// github/reducer.js

// import `createReducer` into your reducer file
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import createReducer from 'atomic-reducer'

import * as actionTypes from './actions'

// Define each atomic reducer by passing action types
const username = createReducer(
  actionTypes.GET_USERNAMES_REQUEST,
  actionTypes.GET_USERNAMES_SUCCESS,
  actionTypes.GET_USERNAMES_FAILURE,
  actionTypes.SET_USERNAMES_ORDER,
  actionTypes.SET_USERNAMES_SELECTED
)

const repo = createReducer(
  actionTypes.GET_REPOS_REQUEST,
  actionTypes.GET_REPOS_SUCCESS,
  actionTypes.GET_REPOS_FAILURE,
  actionTypes.SET_REPOS_ORDER,
  actionTypes.SET_REPOS_SELECTED
)

// optionally compose them together using redux's `combineReducers`
export default combineReducers({ username, repo })
```

This file exports a reducer with the following shape.

```js
{
  username: {
    entities: {},
    order: [],
    selected: null,
    loading: false,
    error: null
  },
  repo: {
    entities: {},
    order: [],
    selected: null,
    loading: false,
    error: null
  }
}
```

Dispatching the corresponding actions will update the relevent part of the
state, taking data from `action.payload`. See [usage](#usage) for more
information on the reducer logic and action format.

## Why would I use this?
It's common for a reducer to manage several entity types. For example a
_GitHub_ reducer might look something like this:

```js
// github reducer initial state
{
  data: {
    repos: {
      enitites: {},
      order: [],
      loading: false
    },
    usernames: {
      entities: {},
      order: [],
      loading: false
    },
    tags: {
      entities: {},
      order: [],
      loading: false
    },
    // ...maybe more, e.g. commits, followers...
  },
  loading: false,
  error: null
}
```

This can lead to bloated reducers, which have to deal with repeated logic across
all these data types.

It's typical to see code like this in these bloated reducers:

```js
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case GET_REPOS_REQUEST:
      return {
        ...state,
        data: {
          ...state.data,
          repos: {
            ...state.data.repos,
            loading: true
          }
        }
      }
    case GET_REPOS_SUCCESS:
      return {
        ...state,
        data: {
          ...state.data,
          repos: {
            ...state.data.repos,
            entities: action.payload,
            loading: false
          }
        }
      }
    case GET_REPOS_FAILURE:
      return { /* ... */ }

    // ...and so on for each entity type...
    default: return state
  }
}
```

As you can imagine, this can easily lead to repetition. Furthermore, it becomes
painful to manage nested state (setting the `loading` property for the `repo`
entity takes 10 lines in this example ðŸ˜µ).

With atomic reducer, the above can be re-written as:

```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import createReducer from 'atomic-reducer'

const repos = createReducer(
  'GET_REPOS_REQUEST',
  'GET_REPOS_SUCCESS',
  'GET_REPOS_FAILURE'
)
const usernames = createReducer(
  'GET_USERNAMES_REQUEST',
  'GET_USERNAMES_SUCCESS',
  'GET_USERNAMES_FAILURE'
)
const tags = createReducer(
  'GET_TAGS_REQUEST',
  'GET_TAGS_SUCCESS',
  'GET_TAGS_FAILURE'
)

export default combineReducers({ repos, usernames, tags })
```

The logic for setting `loading`, `error`, `entities`, `order` and `selected` is
all built in, we just need to pass in the action types.

## Usage

### Creating an atomic reducer

To create an atomic reducer, just pass the actions you want to use for that
entity type to `createReducer`. You don't need to pass them all in, but you need
to provide at least one (otherwise there won't be anyway to dispatch to the
reducer).

As a list of arguments:

```js
const reducer = createReducer(
  'REQUEST_ACTION',
  'SUCCESS_ACTION',
  'FAILURE_ACTION',
  'SET_ORDER_ACTION',
  'SET_SELECTED_ACTION'
)
```

You can also provide actions as an array of strings, with the same constraints
as above:

```js
const reducer = createReducer([
  'REQUEST_ACTION',
  'SUCCESS_ACTION',
  'FAILURE_ACTION',
  'SET_ORDER_ACTION',
  'SET_SELECTED_ACTION'
])
```

Finally, you can pass actions as an object, this is useful if you only want to
provide actions for, say, setting the order. You must provide at least one of
the following keys (other keys are ignored).

```js
const reducer = createReducer({
  request: 'REQUEST_ACTION',
  success: 'SUCCESS_ACTION',
  failure: 'FAILURE_ACTION',
  setOrder: 'SET_ORDER_ACTION',
  setSelected: 'SET_SELECTED_ACTION'
})
```

### Reducer logic

Each atomic reducer responds to the following events

| Event Name | Description | Expected `action.payload` |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `request` | Sets `loading` to `true` | _n/a_
| `success` | Merge `action.payload` with `entities`, sets `loading` to `false` | `object<Key, Value>` |
| `failure` | Sets `error` to `action.payload`, sets `loading` to `false` | `Error` |
| `setOrder` | Sets `order` to `action.payload` | `array<Key>` |
| `setSelected` | Sets `selected` to `action.payload` | `<Key>` |

The exact implementation for each case is as follows.

#### `request`

_No data from action._

```js
case request:
  return {
    ...state,
    loading: true
  }
```

#### `success`

`action.payload` is merged with `state.entities`. Data is merged to prevent data
loss.

```js
case success:
  return {
    ...state,
    entities: {
      ...state.entities,
      ...action.payload
    },
    loading: false
  }
```

#### `failure`

`action.payload` is used to populate `state.error`.

```js
case failure:
  return {
    ...state,
    loading: false,
    error: action.payload
  }
```
##### `setOrder`

`action.payload` sets the `state.order`.

```js
case setOrder:
  return {
    ...state,
    order: action.payload
  }
```

##### `setSelected`

`action.payload` sets `state.selected`.

```js
case setSelected:
  return {
    ...state,
    selected: action.payload
  }
```

## FAQ

##### Q. I want to set entities and order at the same time

A. This is a common pattern, particuarly when using [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr)
where the entities and their order are returned together.
With atomic reducer you'd need to do this in two actions.

For example:

```js
const getUsers = () => (dispatch) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'GET_USERS_REQUEST' })
  return api({ url: '/users' })
    .then(res => normalize(res.data, [ user ]))
    .then(({ result, entities }) => {
      // (1) dispatch normalised data
      dispatch({
        type: 'GET_USERS_SUCCESS',
        payload: entities.users
      })
      // (2) dispatch order
      dispatch({
        type: 'SET_USERS_ORDER',
        payload: result
      })
    })
}
```

Although dispatching two actions might seem like more work, it is more explicit
and gives you greater flexibility in general.
If you hate doing this, then this pattern can easily be extracted to a helper
function which dispatches the two actions for you in one call.
