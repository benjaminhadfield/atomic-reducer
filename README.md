# âš› Atomic Reducer

**Atomic Reducer** encapsulates a common reducer pattern, reducing the amount
of boilerplate you need to write.

## Introduction

An Atomic Reducer looks like this:

```js
{
  entities: {},
  order: [],
  selected: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null
}
```

The idea is that this is the smallest _atmoic_ state unit, to be composed with other atomic reducers to build more complex reducers. The advantage of this is that each entity by definition completely manages it's own data, loading and error states and whether a particular item is selected.

## Why would I use this?
It's common for a reducer to manage several entity types. For example a
_GitHub_ reducer might look something like this:

```js
// github reducer initial state
{
  data: {
    repos: {
      enitites: {},
      order: [],
      loading: false
    },
    usernames: {
      entities: {},
      order: [],
      loading: false
    },
    tags: {
      entities: {},
      order: [],
      loading: false
    },
    // ...maybe more, e.g. commits, followers...
  },
  loading: false,
  error: null
}
```

This can lead to bloated reducers, which have to deal with repeated logic across all these data types.

It's typical to see code like this in these bloated reducers:

```js
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
	switch (action.type) {
    	case GET_REPOS_REQUEST:
        	return {
            	...state,
                data: {
                	...state.data,
                    repos: {
                    	...state.data.repos,
                        loading: true
                    }
                }
            }
    	case GET_REPOS_SUCCESS:
        	return {
            	...state,
                data: {
                	...state.data,
                    repos: {
                    	...state.data.repos,
                        entities: action.payload,
                        loading: false
                    }
                }
            }
        case GET_REPOS_FAILURE:
        	return { /* ... */ }

        // ...and so on for each entity type...
    	default: return state
    }
}
```

As you can imagine, this can easily lead to repetition. Furthermore, it becomes painful to manage nested state (setting the `loading` property for the `repo` entity takes 10 lines in this example ðŸ˜µ).

With atomic reducer, the above can be re-written as:

```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import createReducer from 'atomic-reducer'

const repos = createReducer('GET_REPOS_REQUEST', 'GET_REPOS_SUCCESS', 'GET_REPOS_FAILURE', 'REPOS_SET_ORDER')
const usernames = createReducer('GET_USERNAMES_REQUEST', 'GET_USERNAMES_SUCCESS', 'GET_USERNAMES_FAILURE', 'USERNAMES_SET_ORDER')
const tags = createReducer('GET_TAGS_REQUEST', 'GET_TAGS_SUCCESS', 'GET_TAGS_FAILURE', 'TAGS_SET_ORDER')

export default combineReducers({ repos, usernames, tags })
```

The logic for setting `loading`, `error`, `entities`, `order` and `selected` is all built in, and handling each action type is entirely optional.

## Usage

To create an atomic reducer, just pass the actions you want to use for that entity type to `createReducer`. You don't need to pass them all in, but you need to provide at least one (otherwise there won't be anyway to dispatch to the reducer).

As a list of arguments:

```js
const reducer = createReducer(
  'REQUEST_ACTION',
  'SUCCESS_ACTION',
  'FAILURE_ACTION',
  'SET_ORDER_ACTION',
  'SET_SELECTED_ACTION'
)
```

You can also pass actions as an object, this is useful if you only want to provide actions for, say, the setting the order. You must provide at least one of the following keys (other keys are ignored).

```js
const reducer = createReducer({
	request: 'REQUEST_ACTION',
    success: 'SUCCESS_ACTION',
    failure: 'FAILURE_ACTION',
    setOrder: 'SET_ORDER_ACTION',
    setSelected: 'SET_SELECTED_ACTION'
})
```

You can also provide actions as an array of strings, with the same constraints as above:

```js
const reducer = createReducer([
  'REQUEST_ACTION',
  'SUCCESS_ACTION',
  'FAILURE_ACTION',
  'SET_ORDER_ACTION',
  'SET_SELECTED_ACTION'
])
```
